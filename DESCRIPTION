Description: The surveynnet package extends the functionality of nnet (Venables 
  and Ripley, 2002), which already supports survey weights, by enabling it to handle 
  clustered and stratified data. It achieves this by incorporating design effects 
  through the use of effective sample sizes in the calculations, performed by the 
  package described in Valliant et al. (2023), by following the methods outlined by 
  Chen and Rust (2017) and Valliant et al. (2018).
